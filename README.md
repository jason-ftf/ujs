## Setting up

Description:
I wanted to rehash my memory on rails-ujs and `Rails.ajax`. With a stimulus controller, we can sprinkle dynamic UI in our views. Feel free to pull and contribute. If you have any questions feel free to ping me. 

Requirements:
- rails 6.0.4.7
- webpacker cli `yarn add webpacker-cli`

Installation:

`bundle install`

`rails db:prepare db:seed`

`rails webpacker:install`

`yarn install`

`rails s`
